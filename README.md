## What I found most challenging! ##
/**********************************/
There were time where I had to refer back to MDN doc for clarification regarding grid and flexbox. I've been challenging myself to clean up my CSS so it is more ledgable for viewers. 

Another challenge I faced within the project was the image.svg.. I could not figure it out and I began to get so tired that my problem solving skills turned into frustration.

You will find this at the bottom on the css stylesheet. 

/* Having trouble adding the .svg - Really not even sure what is going on - Probably too tired */
/* .btn[data-icon="shopping-cart"]::before {
    content: "";
    background-image: url("images/icon-cart.svg");
    background-color: #fff;
    width: 15px;
    height: 16px;
} */

I should have been more patient and tried to solve the issue. None the less, I will be back tomorrow for another challenge. 
This is the conclusion on my 4th week of self-taught html & css.
